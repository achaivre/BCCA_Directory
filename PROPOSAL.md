**DIRECTORY OF BCCA GRADUATE INSTITUTE COHORT:**



**Motivation/Description:**
  
  This is to serve multiple purposes. First, its to add to some of the ease of finding each other's information to contact one another. Second, later when added to our portfolios. It could also be used by possible employers to look for information regarding members of the cohort.

The idea is that for now, you will be able to look up a member of the cohort, find their contact information and some of their demographics and their about me presentations.

Later, upon update (once added to our portfolios), it will include any relevant links about that person's socials. A link to their portfolios, their linkedin page, relevant contact emails, and other relevant socials for possible employers.


--------------------------------------------

**Core User Workflow:**
- Collection of all cohort members information for initial project implementation.
- Decide the best way to organize the information.
- How we want user interface to look.
- Write code that does a few things:
- User should be able to:
-  1. Look someone up
   2. Go back to the directory to find someone else.
   3. Have a list of all members that can be looked up pop up
   4. Quit the program
   5. When the person is brought up all relevant information should show up.
   6. Input Validation and allow multiple inputs.

--------------------------------------------

**Ways we could improve this code in the future for future projects:**
- We could add a way to add an entry.
- Add a way to delete an entry (if they have admin passcode)
- Implement a better GUI (perhaps as part of a website interface and make socials clickable links (Replit doesn't allow clicakble links))
- Be able to organize the data by gradutate year.

**Daily Goals:**

**Saturday: All Relevant Information Gathered**

The goal for this day is to collect all relevant informatoin about the cohort to implement in our program. We will also decide what information will be displayed in our directory.

**Tuesday: Basic Quality of Life Functions**

The goal for this day is to write our input helper functions, discuss how our code is going to function and figure out who is responsible for what portion of the code.

**Thursday: Begin inputting collected information**

The goal for this day is to start formatting and inputting directory info in program. (Names A - J)

**Saturday: Finish inputting collected information**

The goal for this day is to start formatting and inputting directory info in program. (Names K-Z)

**Tuesday: Finish Coding Directory**

The goal for this day is to have completed the rest of the coding portion of our program. These features include but are not limited to looking up users, having information of user appear on screen, and making sure all input is validated with relevant functions.

**Thursday: Testing**

The goal for this day is to test our program front and backwards to insure that the quality is top notch!
